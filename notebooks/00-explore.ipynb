    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to use web scraping and apply decision tree models to predict housing prices based on scraped data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a City:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select a city of your choice for which you will scrape housing data. Examples include Chicago, New York, San Francisco, etc.\n",

    "Data Scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use web scraping tools to collect housing data from platforms like Zillow or Redfin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure you gather relevant features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location (address + pincode) , and price.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean and preprocess the data to handle any missing or inconsistent entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables if necessary.\n",

    "Build a Decision Tree Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the scraped data to train a decision tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with different features to see which ones are most predictive of housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis and Reporting:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze the results of your decision tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discuss the features that were most influential in predicting housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit your Python notebook containing the code for data scraping, preprocessing, model training, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Include a brief report summarizing your findings and any insights gained from the task.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium for web scraping.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn for building decision tree models.\n",
    "- Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scraping is already done for you, and the dataset is provided. You have to apply the decision tree and prediction problem to it now.\n"
